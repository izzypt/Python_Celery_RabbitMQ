# Python_Celery_RabbitMQ

Celery and RabbitMQ are two powerful tools often used together in the realm of distributed computing and task queue management, especially within the Python ecosystem.

### What is Celery? 

- Celery is a distributed task queue framework for Python, which allows you to run asynchronous tasks in a distributed manner across multiple workers. 
- These tasks can be anything from small data processing operations to complex, long-running computations.
- Some important concepts in celery are:

  - <ins>Tasks</ins>:
    - Tasks are units of work that you want to execute asynchronously.
    - They can be defined as simple Python functions decorated with ```@celery.task``` or as classes implementing the ```celery.Task``` interface.

  - <ins>Workers</ins>:
    - Workers are processes that execute tasks.
    - Celery supports multiple types of workers, including regular workers for executing tasks, beat workers for handling periodic tasks, and more.

  - <ins>Brokers</ins>:
    - Celery requires a message broker to handle the communication between the client and the workers.
    - This is where RabbitMQ comes into play.

  - <ins>Schedulers</ins>:
    - Celery supports periodic tasks, which are managed by a scheduler.
    - The default scheduler in Celery is Celery Beat.
   
### Why use Celery? 

- Celery simplifies the process of distributing tasks across multiple workers, making it easier to scale your application horizontally.
- It helps in decoupling different parts of your application, allowing for better scalability and fault tolerance.
- Additionally, Celery provides monitoring and management tools to monitor the status of tasks and workers.
